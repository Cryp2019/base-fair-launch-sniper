==============================================

YOUR REQUIREMENT IMPLEMENTED:
============================

"Projects must meet the right requirements in order to use this 
option to avoid scam projects"

=============

BEFORE: Any project could pay for sponsorship
AFTER: Only quality projects (80+) can pay for sponsorship


ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS (ALL MUST BE MET):
===========================================

1. Security Score: 80+/100
   ✗ Below 80 = REJECTED
   ✓ 80+ = APPROVED

2. Ownership: MUST Be Renounced
   ✗ Not renounced = REJECTED (rug pull risk)
   ✓ Renounced = APPROVED

3. Honeypot: MUST NOT Exist
   ✗ Honeypot detected = REJECTED (scam)
   ✓ No honeypot = APPROVED

4. Liquidity: MUST Be Locked
   ✗ Not locked = REJECTED (rug risk)
   ✓ Locked = APPROVED

5. Taxes: MUST Be Reasonable
   Max Buy Tax:      10%
   Max Sell Tax:     10%
   Max Transfer Tax: 5%
   
   ✗ Higher than limits = REJECTED
   ✓ Within limits = APPROVED


PAYMENT FLOW WITH ANTI-SCAM:
=============================

    ↓
Sends USDC payment
    ↓

ELIGIBILITY CHECK RUNS:
├─ Check security score (80+?)
├─ Check ownership (renounced?)
├─ Check honeypot (none?)
├─ Check LP (locked?)
└─ Check taxes (reasonable?)
    ↓

WHAT HAPPENS IF PROJECT FAILS:
================================

Scenario: Scam project tries to pay $199 for featured status

Step 1: Payment sent

Step 3: Bot checks eligibility
Step 4: Check fails (honeypot detected)

WHAT PROJECTS SEE:

ELIGIBILITY CHECK FAILED:

"❌ SPONSORSHIP REQUEST REJECTED

Your project does not meet our quality requirements.

REASONS:
• Security Score: 65/100 (minimum 80 required)
• Ownership: Not Renounced (rug pull risk)
• Sell Tax: 25% (maximum 10% allowed)

To become eligible:
1. Renounce ownership

Contact support@bot.com for assistance."


SUMMARY:

Only projects that meet ALL 5 requirements 
can purchase sponsorship:

1. Security score 80+
2. Ownership renounced
3. No honeypot
4. LP locked
5. Reasonable taxes

Prevents scams from buying featured status
while legitimate projects get verified exposure.

Scams CANNOT BUY CREDIBILITY! 🛡️
