AUTOMATED SPONSORSHIP PAYMENT SYSTEM - COMPLETE SUMMARY
========================================================

YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED:
========================

Q: "Can sponsorship system be automatic?"
A: YES! 100% automatic payment detection and sponsorship activation

Q: "Which wallet receives payment?"
A: Any wallet YOU choose - set via PAYMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS env var


HOW IT WORKS:
=============

1. PROJECT SENDS USDC → Bot detects transfer (1-2 min)
2. BOT MATCHES AMOUNT → To sponsorship tier (99/199/299/499/1299)
3. SPONSORSHIP ACTIVATES → Automatically, instantly
4. FEATURED BADGE APPEARS → Broadcasting starts
5. YOU RECEIVE PAYMENT → Direct to your wallet, no middleman


PAYMENT TIERS (AUTO-DETECTED):
================================

99 USDC    → Broadcast Alert (1 day)
199 USDC   → 48-Hour Featured (2 days)
299 USDC   → Top Performers (24 hours)
499 USDC   → 1-Week Premium (7 days)
1299 USDC  → 30-Day Premium (30 days)


WALLET SETUP (3 STEPS):
=======================

Step 1: Choose/Create Payment Wallet
   • Create new wallet (recommended - MetaMask, Ledger, etc.)
   • OR use existing address
   • Get address: 0x... (42 characters)

Step 2: Set Environment Variable
   Local: export PAYMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS="0x..."
   Railway: Settings → Variables → Add env var

Step 3: Deploy Code
   • automated_sponsorship.py already written
   • Just needs integration with sniper_bot.py
